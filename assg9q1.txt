Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other?

CSS FlexBox:

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

CSS Grid Layout:

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.
