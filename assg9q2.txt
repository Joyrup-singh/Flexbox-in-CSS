Explain the role of the following key properties in flexbox layout model
1. justify-content
2. align-item
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrap

1. Justify-content:

The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).

2. Align-item:

The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container.

In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).
In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.

3. Gap:

The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties:
row-gap.
column-gap.

4. Flex-direction:

The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.
Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.

5. Flex-wrap:

The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect.
